## Tree files

This directory contains tree files called by the [primary analysis R script](.../constrained_species_tree.R) or used by Janus for analyses of mtDNA DNA sequences. Relevant files are used by [Janus](.../janus/) as input trees and are copied in that directory as input files. This directory is provided primarily as a reference for the IQ-tree log files.

***mtDNA_all_codons_constraint***
This directory contains the IQ-tree log files for analyses of the entire concatenated mtDNA dataset (constrained to the MRL3 backbone constraint in Kimball et al 2019).

***mtDNA_loci***
This directory contains the IQ-tree log files for analyses of the separate mtDNA loci, as described in the manuscript.

***mtDNA_proteins_codons_constraint***
This directory contains the IQ-tree log files for analyses of the mtDNA proteins dataset (constrained to the MRL3 backbone constraint in Kimball et al 2019).

***mtDNA_proteins_codons_nond6_constraint***
This directory contains the IQ-tree log files for analyses of the mtDNA proteins dataset (excluding nd6, constrained to the MRL3 backbone constraint in Kimball et al 2019).

***mtDNA_rRNAS_constraint***
This directory contains the IQ-tree log files for analyses of the mtDNA rRNA sequences dataset (constrained to the MRL3 backbone constraint in Kimball et al 2019).
